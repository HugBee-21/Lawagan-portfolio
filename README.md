### 1. Project Overview
Create a website for students of SAMCIS where they can bid and swap there items. It provides a
safe and organized space where students can trade, buy, bid on items they need such as books,

We utilized the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern to separate concerns and ensure the system is scalable.

* **Model:** Handled data logic and database interactions using MySQL.
* **View:** Designed the user interface using [e.g., Java Swing / HTML / JSP].
* **Controller:** Managed the business logic, acting as the bridge between the user inputs and data updates.

### 3. System Artifacts & Diagrams
*As a System Analyst, I focused heavily on the planning phase to ensure data integrity.*
